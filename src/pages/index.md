      A surf charter trip is the ultimate surfers dream. Perfect waves with
      nothing but a few friends and crystal clear water. Surfing all day, then
      relaxing at sunset aboard a gently rocking vessel with a beer. Waking up
      early the next morning for the next surf session. Surf, relax and repeat.

          LTL Surf Charters plants trees to offset your carbon footprint. We
          plant 10 trees per single surfer booking and 100 if you book a private
          charter. We send you the tree certificate after your trip.

          “As a past client of LTL Surfcharters my choice to use their services
          in the future is a resounding hell yeah! We wanted to travel half way
          around the world to the Maldives. I checked with them through a
          recommendation. They have a regularly updated list of last minute
          deals. The process was easy to book and when we landed in the Maldives
          we had staff waiting and ready to lug our bags to the boat.”
