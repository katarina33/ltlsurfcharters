### Mentawais is a tropical archipelago of islands, just off the Sumatran mainland, offering postcard-perfect surf.

Here you will find open ocean swells that roll over shallow coral reef passes, creating some of the most beautiful waves on the planet. The Mentawais consist of a chain of about seventy islands and islets. They lie approximately 150 km off the Sumatran coast. Siberut (4,030 km²) is the largest island. The other major islands are Sipura, North Pagai (Pagai Utara) and South Pagai (Pagai Selatan).

The Mentawai Islands are considered by many as the world’s premium surfing destination. They swell all year round with the **‘peak season’ falling from April to October.**

The gateway to Mentawai is through the city and **airport of Padang**. The best option to get there is **a flight from Kuala Lumpur or Jakarta**. The domestic airlines all accept surfboards. Do double check the conditions for sizes and number of boards. You can book with Air Asia, Mandala, Lion Air, Garuda Airlines, Batavia Air,…

Once you arrive at Padang’s Airport, located 20 km north of town, the boat crew will be there and usually brings you to the harbour immediately. Sometimes you stay at a hotel for the first night. This depends on your arrival time and the boat itinerary. The boat departure times vary. Often they leave in the evening to travel at night. So you will be at the first surf spot by morning, for your first magic surf session.

The Mentawais can be a little crowded during peak season, despite their remoteness. Tourism is based almost exclusively on surfing. A good charter boat with a good guide will go a long way towards that empty perfection. The possibilities are endless and they will do everything to make sure you get the best waves.

A surf charter gives you the opportunity to score the best waves of your life. **Being on a boat out on the ocean, there is lots of flexibility to move to the best spots** at any given time. The crew and guide decide together with the surfers on board to which surf spot you will travel.

The Mentawai Islands are inhabited by local fishermen who are in general very welcoming and friendly. You can get a feeling of the local nature spirits during an island visit, which most boats organise during the trip. Air temperatures are between 22°C ( 72° F) and 32°C ( 90°F). Water temperature is about 27°C ( 80°F)
