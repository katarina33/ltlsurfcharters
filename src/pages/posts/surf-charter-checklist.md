### What do I have to take on a surf charter trip?

First of all, remember that it’s always best to travel light! You don’t need much more than your surfboard, but there are a few essentials not to forget. 

**Most important is a good travel insurance** as it’s mandatory on all boats for your own safety.

Of course, you need to make sure you have **your passport and a visa if necessary** ( depending on your country of residence ) and don’t forget your airline ticket and best **take a passport copy** too. Make sure your deposit and balance payment for your trip are done and that all your travel arrangements are confirmed before you leave.

#### What do you have to bring for in the water? 

Best **2 to 4 surfboards, reef booties, extra leashes, fins, warm water wax** and maybe **a helmet or at least a surf hat** for the sun. A spring wetsuit and/or boardshorts. A **ding repair kit** is a good idea to bring too. Don’t forget your **sunblock** of course.

Take lightweight clothing in your luggage, shoes and sandals and the usual travel stuff like a beach towel, toiletries, your sunglasses, camera and **basic medical kit with seasick pills** and of course your prescription medicine. Surf charter guests often take **headphones** to relax and enjoy some of their favourite music.

It’s a good idea to see your doctor before you leave and have a health check-up. Anti-malaria medication is normally not necessary while staying on a boat although sometimes advised. **Insect repellent** is always best to take.
