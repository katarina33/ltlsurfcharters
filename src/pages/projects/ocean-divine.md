### Ocean Divine is one of the most luxurious vessels in Maldives.

David and Gaelle, the french owners, are on board and offer you a different experience. They provide a 5-star service. They work with a fixed schedule of 7-day trips in surfing season and 7- to 10-day trips for diving.

David is an experienced free-diver, keen surfer and scuba diving instructor. And he has been living in Maldives since 1990. They learn you breathing and relaxation techniques and how to hold your breath longer under water. Diving courses are available on request and they organise dive trips from November to April.

Surf trips are organised from May to October. Spoil yourself to an unforgettable surf charter trip onboard Ocean Divine. Many guests return over and over again. We have Australian surf guides on board that will select the best surf spots for the day, taking notice of all weather conditions.

Ocean Divine has a tender and dingy. You can decide when you want to surf and do what you like all day long. The crew are there for you 24/7. Other activities besides surfing are fishing, snorkeling, SUP and diving. Or just relax, play games or get spoiled at the Spa with a massage, reflexology or shiatsu. We also organise a visit to a local island, sunset cocktails and photo / video viewings of your trip.
