### The Sibon Baru catamaran was designed in Indonesia to run surf charter trips around the Islands in Sumatra.

It cruises at 10 knots and can reach up to 15. The crew is awesome and the chef excellent.

There are 2 route options. The north route going to Banyaks, Telos, Nias,… and up to the Playgrounds area in Mentawai. Or the Mentawai route from Playgrounds up to South Mentawais. Combining both routes is possible for an additional fuel cost.

The Sibon Baru Catamaran has 5 cabins with air-conditioning and 3 bathrooms, sleeping up to 12 guests. The dining and lounging areas are spacious and comfortable. The upper rear deck is the best spot to check the surf and enjoy an ice-cold sunset drink from your comfortable bean-bag.
