### The Dream Surf Charter navigates to the Banyak Islands in Sumatra, Indonesia, a real waves paradise.

As there are only a few surf charter boats sailing these waters, we will get you to surf without the crowds of Mentawais.

Besides surfing, you will experience great fishing, amazing tropical nature and a fantastic adventure trip. Individual bookings are possible and we take groups up to 12 surfers max.

The Dream Surf Charter is located at the Sibolga Harbour in West-Sumatra and will start the trip from there. Overnight you will sail to the Banyak Islands to surf a dozen remote waves. Some waves are still a secret, other known spots are Treasure, Cobra, Bay of Plenty, Lizards and Pulau Babi, which is a swell magnet when it’s flatter.

The boat offers 5 separate large double rooms with large beds (1.4m)and a special cabin with a king size bed for couples. Another room is equipped for 4 guests, giving the boat a capacity of maximum 12 people in addition to the crew and guide. Pierre, the surf guide, has always been on the boat and knows the Banyak Islands as his pocket.

The Dream Surf Charter is considered full with 10 people, but we can take up to 12. All cabins and the comfortable living room are fully air-conditioned. There are 2 bathrooms and a large 45 m2 terrace to check the waves and admire the amazing sunsets.

The Banyak Islands are a group of about 71 inhabited islands off the western coast of Sumatra. The largest island is Tuangku with Haloban as the principal town. On request, we can organise trips to the Telo Islands. Here you can find a variety of fun waves with a good range of power for intermediate to advanced surfers. Usually, there is a good opportunity for barrels in these clear waters with numerous lefts and rights reefs and long wrapping points.

#### INCLUDED:
- unlimited surfing

#### NOT INCLUDED:
- domestic return flight in Sibolga ( US$ 100) with surfboard transport @ $AUD 20 per board each way.

#### IMPORTANT:
- For your domestic flight, you have to arrive the day before. If your trip leaves on the 10th for example, you must arrive on the 9th in Medan ( via Kuala Lumpur or Singapore), ideally in the evening. The boards will be picked up on your arrival and routed over land to Sibolga by car. 
- On the way back, make sure you leave after 8 pm, as the surfboards will be brought back overland from the boat to Medan again. 
- You will have to take an internal flight from Medan (KNO) to Sibolga (FLZ). 
- Trip dates are usually from Monday to Friday, so you can travel on the weekend. The schedule is fixed but flexible with 1-2 days.

#### The Dream Surf Charter owners offer an optional package to make your arrival and departure easier and relax @ 300 US$:  
They can pick you up at the international airport and bring you to the Marriott Hotel. The next morning you will be brought to the airport for your flight to Sibolga with your flight ticket in your pocket. All is included, except the dinner and drinks at the hotel. The same for your departure back home. This package includes the hotel, breakfast, taxi and return flights with boards.

### REVIEWS:

#### ***Steven, Trip 5 to 16 August 2019:***

An amazing trip for us all. A great crew and a very comfortable boat to live on. Pierre led us to great waves and we had a ball hanging out with him, he’s a real asset to your company. Suggestions for improvement would be a speed boat tender large enough for all.

#### ***Arnaud, Trip 15 to 26 April 2019:***

Je ne sais par où commencer tellement je suis extremement heureux et satisfait de mon premier boat trip et ce grâce à toute l équipe du DREAM!!!!!!

Si je devais résumer en un seul mot, ce serait la CLASSE!(ou la CLAQUE) car tout, je dis bien TOUT a été pensė ,réfléchi ou prévu pour que ce soit bien,bon ,facile ,comfortable , délicieux , copieux ,etc.

Habitué et habitant en Indo, je ne pouvais m’attendre à un tel niveau de qualité et de compétences à travers le professionnalisme, le sérieux et la gentillesse des membres du crew tout ça mené d une main de maître par Pierre, un homme comme on en rencontre peu de nos jours, “personnage “unique et attachant, marin aguerri… une bien belle rencontre et un trip inoubliable…..!!!

Je signe pour un abonnement multi-annuel…….

#### ***Luke, Trip 15 to 26 April 2019:***

Amazing trip. Boat, crew, food and waves were amazing. Definitely will be coming back as I missed out on some amazing waves as my skill level and balls were not big enough!!

Thanks for everything.

#### ***Mehdi, Trip 18 to 29 March 2019:***

All amazing. Staff, boat, islands, water, etc… only good things to say. I’m not going to go through everything but here are a few highlights: Pierre’s knowledge of the islands, the wind, the break, the reef made a huge difference. We felt confident we were at the right spot at the right time. Definitely ahead of the one other boat. The crew was fantastic. Always available with a big smile. Never taking themselves too seriously which helped because we were probably not the most mature. Food was good, it must be hard to cook in these conditions and never was worried about the freshness.

Opportunities (mostly because I’m barely an intermediate surfer): communication ahead of the trip with what is needed, how to prepare, the type of boards, the repair kit, etc… same for how to prepare physically to be able to surf 4/6h per day. Think set of 5 emails that gets you ready, and prepare you for the trip.

Also, the opportunity to sell coaching packages with video, etc… Pierre did it naturally, but I would pay for having something more formal every day. Maybe hard to execute but just an idea.
